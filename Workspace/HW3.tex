  (UAG 5.1) A rgular function on $\mathbb{P}^1$ is constant. Deduce that there are no non-constant morphisms $\mathbb{P}^1 \to \A^m$ for $m \geq 1$.
 \end{prob}

\sol. Suppose  $f \in k(\mathbb{P}^1)$ be a rational function, which is regular everywhere. If we restrict it to the affine piece $\A_{(0)}$, we get $f(x,1) = p(x) \in k[x]$ (as for the case of affine variety $\operatorname{dom} f = V$ iff $f \in k[V]$). Similarly, we can restrict $f$ to another affine piece $\A_{\infty}$. We get, $f(1,y) = f(1/y,1) = p(1/y) \in k[y]$. It is possible iff $p$ is constant.

\noindent Any morphisms  $\mathbb{P}^1 \to \A^m$ can be given by $(f_1,\cdots,f_m)$ where $f_i$ are regular on $\mathbb{P}^1$. Thus the function $f$ is constant by the previous part. \Qed

    (UAG 5.7) Let $\varphi : \mathbb{P}^1 \to \mathbb{P}^1$ be an isomorphism; identify graph of $\varphi$ as subvariety of $\mathbb{P}^1 \times \mathbb{P}^1\subset \mathbb{P}^3$. Now do the same if $\varphi : \Pn^1 \to \Pn^1$ is given by map $(X,Y)\mapsto (X^2,Y^2)$.
\end{prob} 

\sol. Consider the identity map $\id : \Pn^1 \to \Pn^1$ and the given isomorphism, it will give us a map $\id \times \varphi :\Pn^1 \times \Pn^1 \to \Pn^1\times \Pn^1$ by $(x,y)\mapsto (x,\varphi(x))$. Under the identification of $\Pn^1 \times \Pn^1 = \Pn^3$ we can say, $\id \times \varphi$ is also a morphism of variety. In the variety $\Pn^1 \times \Pn^1$, the diagonal $\D = \qty{(x,x): x \in \Pn^1}$ is closed (simply because it is given by the vanishing of $x_0-x_2$ and $x_1-x_3$ where $[x_0:x_1]$ and $[x_2:x_3]$ are co-ordinates of two copies of $\Pn^1$). It's not hard to see the graph of $\varphi$ is given by the inverse image of $\D$ under $\id \times \varphi$. $$\Gamma(\varphi)= (\id \times \varphi)^{- 1}(\D)$$ Since the graph is closed it's inverse image will also be closed. Thus the graph is a closed set and under zariski topology any closed set is given by vanishing of some set of polynomials. This will help us to identify $\Gamma(\varphi)$ as a subvariety of $\Pn^1\times \Pn^1$. If $\varphi$ is given by $[x:y]\to [f(x,y):g(x,y)]$ then the graph can be given by the image of following vanishing set under segre embedding $$\qty{[x_0:x_1:x_2:x_3]: x_2 =f(x_0,x_1), x_3=g(x_0,x_1)}$$

\noindent If, $\varphi$ given by $[x,y]\mapsto [x^2:y^2]$ the image of $([x:y],[x^2,y^2])$ is $[x^3:xy^2:yx^2:y^3]$(image under segre embedding). Which is rational curve $\Pn^1 \to \Pn^3$, a sub-variety of $\Pn^3$.
$$\Gamma(\varphi)\simeq \text{Rational curve in }\Pn^3$$

    (UAG 5.13) Study the embedding $\varphi : \Pn^2 \to \Pn^5$ given by $[x:y:z] \mapsto [x^2:xy:yz:y^2:yz:z^2]$ and prove that $\varphi$ is an isomorphism. Prove that the lines of $\Pn^2$ go over the conics of $\Pn^5$ and the conics go over the twisted quartics of $\Pn^5$.

    \vspace*{0.2cm}

    \noindent For any line $\ell \subset \Pn^2$, write $\pi(\ell) \subseteq \Pn^5$ for the projective plane spanned by the conics $\varphi(\ell)$. Prove that union of $\pi(\ell)$ taken over all $\ell \Pn^2$ is a cubic hypersurface $\Sigma \subseteq \Pn^5$.
